> [!WARNING]  
> This repo is a personal workflow tool and is not built for public use. It's built in a way that can be picked up by anyone, but it requires very specific spec files in the specs/* folder that have to be created by talking to an agent, and making it write tasks into the folder. This tool doesn't generate specs for you yet.


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.27. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
